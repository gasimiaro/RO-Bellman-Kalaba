# RO-Bellman-Kalaba
This repository contains a simple implementation of the Bellman-Kalaba algorithm for pathfinding. The project is structured into two main components: the front end and the back end (processing logic).

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (for the front end)
- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (for the back end)

### Front End Setup

To set up and run the front end:

1. Navigate to the `front/client` directory:
   ```bash
   cd front/client
   ```
2. Install dependencies and start the application:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

### Back End Setup

To set up and run the back end:

1. Navigate to the `back/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd back
   ```
2. Create a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the Bellman-Kalaba algorithm script:
   ```bash
   python3.10 Bellman.py
   ```
